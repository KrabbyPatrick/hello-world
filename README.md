# hello-world
This is my first time using github and my very first repository

And this is my first time making a new branch from the master branch

My name is Patrick John Ramirez
I'm 17 years old

I like programming. I have a good amount of knowledge in HTML and CSS although there are still some topics that I still haven't learned just yet. Right now I am trying to learn how to use GitHub as it has been mentioned from quiet a lot of tutorial videos and articles that I have seen. I heard a lot of good stuff about GitHub like the version control and collabaration features of it. I also heard that you can host static websites/blogs in GitHub for free which is really-really awesome and so I'm really excited with that. 

With that said, I'm gonna continue learning about GitHub.
